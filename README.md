## Introduction

The matching cards game or matching pairs game is a memory game. It engages the sense of vision and tests to see if the player or players can recall patterns or positions.

## How to play

The game begins when the start button is pressed. It triggers the timer and the user is then allowed to begin flipping the cards. Each card has a twin of itself, i.e a matching card. The user must flip the cards engaging their vision to remember the position of each flipped card in case they encounter the twin of one of the cards they have previously flipped. Only two cards can be flipped at a time. If a match is made, the flipped cards remain in their flipped state, otherwise they return to their previous state. The aim of the game is to match all the cards in record time. The fastest time taken for all cards to be matched with their twins or pairs is the game's high score.

The game is automatically set to easy level but you can increase the number of available cards to match by changing the level to intermediate or hard.

## Instructions

- Remember to click the start button before you attempt flipping.
- Click the restart button to restart the game if you choose to end the current progress. All cards will be returned to their original unflipped state.
- The game is accompanied with sounds. Reduce the volume of your device if you are in a no-noise area or if you do not want any sounds.
